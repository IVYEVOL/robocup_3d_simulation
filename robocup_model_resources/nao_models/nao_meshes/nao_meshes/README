This package contains the official textured meshes for Aldebaran's NAO robot.
You can use directly the meshes located in the meshes//V40/ directory.


Change the color of your NAO
=============================
modify the textureNAO.png in the texture directory
each color block corresponds to a part of the robot. Modify the color of any block and the meshes will change color accordingly

Export meshes from a blender file
==================================
You can also convert your meshes yourself from the officiel blender file provided by Aldebaran.
To do so, run the "exportMeshes.py" script : 
1) copy the aldebaran blender file to the script directory
2) go to the script directory
3) run : rosrun nao_meshes exportMeshes.py -b ~/SoftNao/blender-2.71-linux-glibc211-x86_64/ -f nao-v4textured.blend -s ~/catkin_ws/src/nao_meshes/scripts
    -b parameter is the path of your blender directory
    -s in the path of the script directory
    -f is the name of the blender file to process
